# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: Vishva Koladiya

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Summary
Pokemon is an android app that shows you are random Pokemon's image, name, height, and weight when you press refresh. 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üò≤ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üåö 

## Application Features
The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [X] Add a query to the API request
  - The query added to the API request is the Pokemon ID, which is a random integer between 1 and 898 generated. The generated random ID is concatenated with the base URL of the PokeAPI to form the complete URL for the API request.
- [X] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you added to improve the app!
  - Picasso image loading

## API Choice
My chosen API for this project is Pokemon API https://pokeapi.co/.
